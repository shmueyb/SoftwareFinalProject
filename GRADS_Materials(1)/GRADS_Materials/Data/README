Notes on data files:

These files are in the JSON format. To read them into GRADS, it is easiest to use Google's GSON library, which can be downloaded from here: http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/

For example, to deserialize (read text into object model):
 
List<StudentRecord> studentRecords = new Gson().fromJson( new FileReader( new File("students.txt")), new TypeToken<List<StudentRecord>>(){}.getType());

and then to serialize (write object model back to text):

List<StudentRecord> students = ...
new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create().toJson(students);

----------------------

For the project, you will need to read in:
students.txt (student records)
courses.txt (courses offered by the department)
users.txt (user permissions)

progress.txt is an example of a partial progress summary written back to a file. You don't need to read it into your system. It is just included as an example. 

For student records, you can use the StudentRecord class we gave you. Courses can also use the classes we gave you. For user permissions, you'll have to create your own data object.
